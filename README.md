results of covid19 testing in Scotland

##Source
The source of data to 13 March 2020 is the [Internet Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/search.php?query=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.scot%2Fcoronavirus-covid-19%2F). From 14 March 2020 the data is sourced directly from the Scottish Government's [webpage](https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/).

I am currently looking for an API similar to Public Health England's one.
