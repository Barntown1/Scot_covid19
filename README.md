results of covid19 testing in Scotland

## Source
The source of data from 06 March to 13 March 2020 is the [Internet Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/search.php?query=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.scot%2Fcoronavirus-covid-19%2F). From 14 March 2020 the data is sourced directly from the Scottish Government's [webpage](https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/), and for now is manually added.

A friend supplied me with data from 24 Jan 2020 to 6th March to fill in gaps. 

I am currently looking for an API similar to Public Health England's one to automate updates.
